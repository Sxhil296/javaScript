# Object Oriented in JavaScript

## Do javaScript really have classes?
JavaScript does have a concept called "classes," introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. However, it's important to note that JavaScript's classes are primarily syntactical sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system. In other words, JavaScript's classes provide a more structured and familiar way to work with objects and inheritance, but they are still based on prototypes under the hood.
