*javascript is synchronous and single threaded by default

*synchronous - code will executed sequentially
*slow due to single threaded


*execution context
-execute one line of code at a time


*blocking code vs non blocking code
-non blocking code can be run while other tasks are running in the background.  Blocking code cannot do this, it must wait for that task

-blocking code block the flow of program
-blocking code reads file sync

-non blocking code doesn't block execution
-non blocking reads file async


*JS engine consists of memory heap and call stack
